          <p>This project is tracking Quake Live duel matches for players and ranking each player on the Glicko 2 scale. Fetching of a player is done once a week and ranking also updates once a week since each week is regarded as a "tournament". Note that this removes smaller fluctuations in ranking over time since the player is smoothed.</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>How is the ranking done</dt>
            <dd>Matches you play are eventually scanned by the crawler. It is pretty slow since it does not want to overload the QL site. When the matches have been crawled, all matches less than a minute is filtered out. The reason is that we are trying to guage skill levels of players and not even trying doesn't count. Then the matches are entered into the Glicko 2 ranking system for updating the <em>Rank</em> and the <em>Rank Deviation</em>. The first number is the current skill level and the second tracks the confidence in that skill level by the system. We box-plot the latter so a player may have some idea of where he or she are, ranking-wise.</dd>
            <dt>When did you start collecting data?</dt>
            <dd>Data collection started from the 1st of February 2012. I may have missed a couple of early matches around that point in time.</dd>
            <dt>What are the initial configuration values for Glicko 2?</dt>
            <dd>Starting rank r = 1500, the initial rank deviation is 397, the σ value is 0.07 and τ = 0.3. These values have been found by a simulated annealing experiment based on 13 weeks of matches. It is ongoing work to re-rank on 41+ weeks of matches.</dt>
            <dt>Isn't the boxplots the wrong plot to use for the ranking?</dt>
            <dd>Correct</dd>
            <dt>What is this "Match Streak" thing?</dt>
            <dd>The system looks up the last 150 matches by the player and reports how the player fared on those matches. This means that if a player mostly plays Bloodrun/ZTN, the list will be longer for that map. It gives a great visual overview of what maps the player has played recently.</dd>
            <dt>What tools are used for this site?</dt>
            <dd>The front-end is written in a combination of jQuery, the jQuery sparkline plugin and the bootstrap.js framework, originally by Twitter. The backend is written in the programming language Erlang by Ericsson and uses the Cowboy web server to serve requests.</dd>
            <dt>What is the affiliation to the QLRanks site?</dt>
            <dd>We are not connected in any way. I respect the work done by QLRanks which is awesome. Their match data is more online which means they have results faster and they know a lot more about what is happening <em>right now</em> on Quake Live. QLGlicko is more interested in long-term rankings of players and as such uses a more advanced and computationally intensive algorithm. QLGlicko is always lagging behind current performance by some margin. Usually about 1 to 1.5 weeks.</dd>
            <dt>Can't you rank TDM or CTF also?</dt>
            <dd>Glicko 2 is explicitly a 1v1 ranking system. It is not possible to adopt it to a multiplayer situation. We would need to employ a different ranking system.</dd>
            <dt>How about CA then?</dt>
            <dd>CA is not a competitive mode, so go to hell. Only mad frenchmen like H3artless plays it. More seriously though, the problem with CA is the same as with TDM and CTF. We need another ranking system for those.</dd>
            <dt>My question is not answered!</dt>
