  <h1>Nothing to see here yet</h1>
  <p>Originally, I had some test code here, but it is becoming more and more apparent it wouldn't really rock in the long run. Hence, everything will be replaced with a new front-end. The work is ongoing, and the following pieces of code lists what is going on.</p>
  <h2>Alpha testing</h2>
  <p>We are currently testing a new number of new features:</p>
  <div class="map count">
    <p>The following graph shows the current count of played matches in the database, visualized through the d3.js library. It pulls data asynchronously from the underlying system, and serves as a tool for showing how to implement these things in more detail for individual users later on.</p>
    <p>Do note we only show maps which have been played at least 25000 times. Maps with fewer duels are removed from the pool at the moment.</p>
